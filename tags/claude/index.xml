&lt;p>The task I put it up to was to help me show the hidden posts of this Hugo site, as I had no clues. Honestly, I was surprised to hit a speed bump already, having to buy some token credits first ($5) without any trial. But then it correctly suggested that I forgot about the &lt;code>draft: true&lt;/code> front matter field I had copy-pasted in multiple locations.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
