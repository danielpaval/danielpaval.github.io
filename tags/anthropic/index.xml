It took a bit of time to get the CLI going as Claude Code only works on Linux, and my WSL Node.js setup was both old and misconfigured.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The task I put it up to was to help me show the hidden posts of this Hugo site, as I had no clues. Honestly, I was surprised to hit a speed bump already, having to buy some token credits first ($5) without any trial. But then it correctly suggested that I forgot about the &lt;code>draft: true&lt;/code> front matter field I had copy-pasted in multiple locations.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
