I just got to make a bit of progress on building a technical blog which is something I started to think about a few years ago. Back at the beginning, the focus was on getting familiar with static site generators, mainly Jekyll and Hugo.

Now, I'm going with Hugo for, mostly, simplicity:

| Feature            | Hugo 🏎️                                    | Jekyll 📝                                 |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Performance**    | ⚡ Extremely fast (built with Go)            | 🚶 Slower (built with Ruby)               |
| **Installation**   | ✅ Single binary, no dependencies            | ❌ Requires Ruby and Bundler               |
| **Templates**      | ⚠️ Uses Go templates (harder to learn)      | ✅ Uses Liquid templates (easier)          |
| **Content Format** | ✅ Markdown, TOML/YAML/JSON                  | ✅ Markdown, YAML                          |
| **Plugins**        | ❌ No plugin system (built-in features only) | ✅ Supports plugins for more functionality |
| **GitHub Pages**   | ⚠️ Requires extra setup                     | ✅ Natively supported                      |
| **Ease of Use**    | ❌ Steeper learning curve                    | ✅ Easier for beginners                    |
| **Best For**       | 🚀 Speed, large sites, developers           | ✍️ Blogs, simple websites, GitHub Pages   |
