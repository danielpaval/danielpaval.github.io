Not long ago Windows on my laptop reported that Skype was last used on 1/1/1601.. While I rarely use Skype now-a-days, it surely wasn&amp;rsquo;t that long! January 1st does hint at some kind of a date baseline, just like the Unix epoch, but why 1601?
Of course, this was a quick answer to look up and it turns out to be that &amp;ldquo;1601 was the first year of the 400-year Gregorian calendar cycle at the time Windows NT was made&amp;rdquo; 1.</description></item></channel></rss>
